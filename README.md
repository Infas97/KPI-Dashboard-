# KPI-Dashboard
# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive KPI Dashboard designed to evaluate and visualize performance metrics in manufacturing operations. The dashboard is split into Primary KPIs and Secondary KPIs, offering insights into factory and supplier performance, as well as sample room operations.

The KPI Dashboard provides data-driven insights to monitor performance trends and identify areas for improvement, supporting strategic decision-making.

# Primary KPIs
The Primary KPIs focus on Factory and Supplier Performance:

Performance by Week: Tracks weekly performance trends to provide a granular view of productivity and efficiency.

Month-to-Date (MTD) Performance: Aggregates performance metrics over the current month for a broader perspective.

These KPIs enable stakeholders to monitor overall production health and supplier reliability in real-time.
